# C-programs
 
Basic Programing:
  
  - Find ASCII Value of Character
  - Using gets() function
  - Checking for Vowel
  - Reversing Case of Character 
  - Program to find Factorial of number 
  - Fibonacci Series Program
  - Palindrome Program
  - Program to find Sum of Digits
  - Program to reverse a String
  - Armstrong Number
  - Checking input number for Odd or Even
  - Print Factors of a Number
  - Print first n Prime Numbers
  - Exponential without pow() function
  - Find whether number is int or float
  
Arrays:
  - Array operations:
    - Reverse an Array
    - Insert Element to Array
    - Delete Element from Array
    - Sort Array Elements
    - Remove Duplicate Elements

Pointers:
  - Program for Dynamic Memory Allocation using malloc() and clearing out memory space using free(). sizeof() returns the number of bytes occupied by any datatype, in this case by an integer
