Arrays:
  - Array operations:
    - Reverse an Array
    - Insert Element to Array
    - Delete Element from Array
    - Sort Array Elements
    - Remove Duplicate Elements

Pointers:
  - Program for Dynamic Memory Allocation using malloc() and clearing out memory space using free(). sizeof() returns the number of bytes occupied by any datatype, in this case by an integer
